For the final project we will simulate a library management software.  
For this you are given two files. Booklist.txt and librarylog.txt 

 
Booklist.txt includes a line for each book in the library in the following form:

<book name>#<number of copies>#<restricted>

Where <book name> indicates the name of the book, <number of copies indicates> how many copies the library has and <restricted> is a TRUE/FALSE value indicating if the book has borrowing restrictions.

For example if booklist.txt contains

Introduction to python#3#TRUE

Eye of the world#1#FALSE

it means 

The library has 3 copies of Introduction to python and it has borrowing restrictions. 
It also has one copy of Eye of the world and there are no borrowing restrictions for that book. 
Borrowing restrictions for a book means the book can be borrowed for at most 7 days. 
Books with no borrowing restrictions can be borrowed for upto 28 days.

 

Next we are given a log of the library's working in the form of librarylog.txt . Each line of text of the log is of one of the following types:

1) Borrow notation

B#<day>#<Student Name>#<Book name>#<days borrowed for>

2) Return notation

R#<day>#<Student Name>#<Book name>

3) Book addition

A#<day>#<Book name>

4) Fine pay notation

P#<day>#<student name>#<amount>

 

For example a librarylog.txt which has

B#1#adam#harry potter#6

R#10#adam#harry potter

A#11#Introduction to programming

P#15#adam#5

 

indicates adam borrowed harry potter on day 1 for 6 days. 
Adam then returned harry potter on day 10 (he was thus 3 days late). 
On day 11 a copy of introduction to programming was added to the library. 
Finally on day 15 adam paid 5 dollors towards the owed library fine dues.

 

The rules of the library are :

Restricted books can be borrowed for at most 7 days. 
Non restricted books can be borrowed for 28 days.

Books returned late are fined 5 a day for each day late for restricted books, 1 per day late for non restricted books. 

Any library user can have at most 3 books borrowed at a time.

A library user can only borrow if they have no pending fines.

New books to the library can be added as per the log, these are in addition to the original list of books in booklist. (The added book can already exist in which case its an additional copy or can be a new book)

A book can only be borrowed if there is an unborrowed copy in the library.

 

You program should process booklist and librarylog

And be able to answer the following questions.

1) Can a student borrow a book on a particular day for a certain number of days (this depends on how many copies remain in the library, if the person has any pending fines or too many borrowed books and consider book restriction conditions)

2) What are the most borrowed/popular books in the library (How many days were they borrowed vs not borrowed) .

3) Which books have the highest borrow ratio. 
You have to consider how many copies are there for this also. 
For example if a book has 10 copies from day 1 and 1 copy was always borrowed but another book has only 2 copies and 1 copy was borrowed half the number of days. 
The 2nd book has more borrow ratio. Basically for how much of the books were available vs how much they got borrowed.

4) Be able to product sorted lists of most borrowed books/ books with highest usage ratio.

5) What are the pending fines at the end of the log/at a specific day in the log.

Hi I am uploading this brief sample file with expected answers so you can start testing you program.

 

I will be uploading a test page also this week where you can test with a larger booklist and librarylog. I am also going to make another announcement with commonly asked questions.

However, I am posting this so it clears up some doubts. Assuming you are given the following two files:

booklist.txt  Download booklist.txt 

librarylog-1.txt  Download librarylog-1.txt 

You have a list of two books and a third book gets added using the library log.

(Book addition clarification: Books added due to library log if new are assumed not to be restricted. If they are a book which already exists its restricted type is the restricted type of the original book. The new book added does not exist so it is not restricted)

Given this library log . The answers to questions of the various types are as follows.

1) Can a student borrow a book on a particular day for a certain number of days (this depends on how many copies remain in the library, if the person has any pending fines or too many borrowed books and consider book restriction conditions)

Examples: 

Can lauren borrow harry potter on day 2? No as the only copy is borrowed.

Can lauren borrow harry potter on day 11? Yes

Can Adam borrow harry potter on day 12? No, he has a pending fine due to a late return

 

2) What are the most borrowed/popular books in the library (How many days were they borrowed vs not borrowed) .

For given example

The days each book was borrowed are:

harry potter 9 days by adam

Eye of the world 3 days by Lauren

Introduction to programming 3 days and then 4 days by Ishan

So the books sorted by most popular (total borrowed days are):

harry potter 9

Introduction to programming 7

Eye of the world 3

 

3) Which books have the highest borrow/ratio ratio. You have to consider how many copies are there for this also . For example if a book has 10 copies from day 1 and 1 copy was always borrowed but another book has only 2 copies and 1 copy was borrowed half the number of days. The 2nd book has more borrow ratio. Basically for how much of the books were available vs how much they got borrowed.

For the given files

Note while harry potter was borrowed 9 days it was available for 29 days.  Thus its usage ratio is ~31.034% (Books in booklist are added day 1, end date is number indicated at end of list so day 30)

Eye of the world was borrowed for 3 days but it was only available for 15 days . It was added later via the library log. So its usage ratio is 20%

Introduction to programming was borrowed 7 days 

Introduction to programming however had 3 copies available from day 1. Thus it was borrowed. 7 days out of a total of 87 days available across all copies. Thus its usage ratio is ~8.0459%

 

4) Be able to produce sorted lists of most borrowed books/ books with highest usage ratio.

This is covered in sections 2/3. This part just involves sorting the book lists according to most borrowed or usage ratios.

 

5) What are the pending fines at the end of the log/at a specific day in the log.

At the end of librarylog (day 30)

adam had a fine of 3 dollars as he returned a non-restricted book 3 days late on day 10 instead of 7 (which is when he should have returned it given he borrowed it on day 1 for 6 days). He then paid 2 dollars off his fine. So he still has a dollar left.

ishan had a fine of 5 since he returned 1 day late on a restricted book.

If asked the same question on day 12 Adam was the only one with a 3 dollar fine.
